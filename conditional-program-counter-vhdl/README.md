# Conditional Program Counter (VHDL)

## Overview
This project implements a conditional program counter in VHDL.
The counter increments sequentially or jumps to a specified address
based on control signals and condition flags.

## Features
- Synchronous program counter
- Conditional branching logic
- Step/run clock control
- Testbench-based verification
- FPGA-ready top-level module (DE10-Lite)

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Sequential digital logic
- Control signal decoding
- FSM-style behavior
- VHDL testbench design

## Tools
- VHDL
- Quartus Prime
- ModelSim
- DE10-Lite FPGA
